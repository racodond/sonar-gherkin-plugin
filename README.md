## SonarQube Cucumber Gherkin Analyzer
This [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org) plugin analyzes [Cucumber Gherkin feature files](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference#gherkin) and:

 * Computes metrics: lines of code, number of scenarios, etc.
 * Checks various guidelines to find out potential bugs and code smells through more than [40 checks](#available-rules)
 * Provides the ability to write your own checks


## Usage
1. [Download and install](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Setup+and+Upgrade) SonarQube
1. Install the Cucumber Gherkin plugin by a [direct download](https://github.com/racodond/sonar-gherkin-plugin/releases). The  latest version is compatible with SonarQube 5.6+.
1. Install your [favorite scanner](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+Source+Code#AnalyzingSourceCode-RunningAnalysis) (SonarQube Scanner, Maven, Ant, etc.)
1. [Analyze your code](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+Source+Code#AnalyzingSourceCode-RunningAnalysis)


### Maven
It is likely that your feature files are not located in source code directories but in test directories. By default, SonarQube doesn't analyze those test directories. Thus, you have to explicitly tell SonarQube to also analyze the test directories containing your feature files.

Let's say that the structure of your project is:
```                
pom.xml
src
  |-- main
        |-- java
        |-- resources
  |-- test
        |-- java
        |-- resources
              |-- features
                    |-- my-feature.feature
                    |-- my-other-feature.feature
                                   
                
```         

In you POM file, you would need to add:
```             
<properties>
  <sonar.sources>pom.xml,src/main/java,src/main/resources,src/test/resources/features</sonar.sources>
</properties>  
```


## Custom Checks
You're thinking of new valuable rules? Version 1.0 or greater provides an API to write your own custom checks.
A sample plugin with detailed explanations is available [here](https://github.com/racodond/sonar-gherkin-custom-rules-plugin).
If your custom rules may benefit the community, feel free to create a pull request in order to make the rule available in the Cucumber Gherkin analyzer.

You're thinking of new rules that may benefit the community but don't have the time or the skills to write them? Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/racodond/sonar-gherkin-plugin/issues) for your rules to be taken under consideration.
