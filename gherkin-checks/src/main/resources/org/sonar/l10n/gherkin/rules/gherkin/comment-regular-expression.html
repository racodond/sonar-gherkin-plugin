<p>
    This rule template can be used to create rules that will raise an issue when a specific pattern is found in a
    comment.
</p>
<p>
    For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression "<code>WTF</code>" to match all comment
    containing "WTF". Note that, in order to match WTF regardless of the case, the "<code>(?i)</code>" modifier can be
    prepended to the expression, as in "<code>(?i)WTF</code>".

    documentation</a> for detailed regular expression syntax.
